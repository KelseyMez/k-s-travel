            so it wont be hard to find a nice hotel with luxurious
            views.<br>You could get a few of the sea or one of 6000
            islands the greek isles has to offer. Or you could get

            In Greece you could choose to visit Parthenon. It is a
            former temple on the Athenian Acropolis that was dedicated
            to the goddess Athena.<br>The Parthenon was built in thanksgiving
            for the Hellenic victory over Persian Empire invaders during
            the Greco-Persian Wars. Like most Greek temples, the
            Parthenon also served as the city treasury.

            Greek cuisine is characteristic of the Mediterranean diet, which is
            epitomised by dishes of Crete. Greek cuisine incorporates fresh
            ingredients into a variety of local dishes such as moussaka, pastitsio,
            classic Greek salad, fasolada, spanakopita and souvlaki.<br>Some dishes
            can be traced back to ancient Greece like skordalia, lentil soup,
            retsina and pasteli. Throughout Greece people often enjoy eating from
            small dishes such as meze with various dips such as tzatziki, grilled
            octopus and small fish, feta cheese and dolmades.

            The climate of Greece is primarily Mediterranean, featuring
            mild to cool, wet winters and hot, dry summers. This climate
            occurs at most of the coastal locations, including Athens,
            the Cyclades, the Dodecanese, Crete, the Peloponnese, the
            Ionian Islands and parts of mainland Greece.<br>The Pindus
            mountain range strongly affects the climate of the country,
            as areas to the west of the range are considerably wetter on
            average than the areas lying to the east of the range resulting
            to some coastal areas in the south falling to the hot semi-arid
            climate category, such as parts of the Athens Riviera and some of
            the Cyclades, as well as some areas in the north featuring a cold
            equivalent climate, such as the cities of Thessaloniki and Larissa.

            The ocean surrounding Greece is called the Aegean sea. The Aegean Sea
            is an elongated embayment of the Mediterranean Sea and covers about
            214,000 square kilometres (83,000 sq mi) in area, measuring about 670
            kilometres (420 mi) longitudinally and 390 kilometres (240 mi) latitudinal.
            <br>The sea's maximum depth is 2,639 metres (8,658 ft), located at a point
            west of Karpathos. The Aegean Islands are found within its waters, with the
            following islands delimiting the sea on the south, generally from west to east
            while the Sea of Crete is the southern section.
