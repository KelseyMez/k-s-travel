            While in Japan you could go and visit Mount Fuji.
            It is easier to see in the colder months as the clouds
            dont cover it up.<br>Another easy way to view Mount Fuji 
            is from the train on a trip between Tokyo and Osaka. 
            If you take the shinkansen from Tokyo in the direction 
            of Nagoya, Kyoto and Osaka, the best view of the mountain
            can be enjoyed from around Shin-Fuji Station on the right 
            hand side of the train, about 40-45 minutes into the journey.
            The mountain can also be seen in both of these cities.

            Tokyo mixes the ultramodern and traditional, from neon-lit 
            skyscrpaers to historic temples. You could also visit the 
            Tokyo skytree, which stands at 634m(2,080ft) abov sea level.
            <br>There are multiple museums and national parks. There are
            lots of sights all around Japan for you to explore.

            Japan's constitution guarantees full religious freedom. Upper 
            estimates suggest that 84 to 96 percent of the Japanese population
            subscribe to Shinto as its indigenous religion. However, these 
            estimates are based on people affiliated with a temple, rather than 
            the number of true believers.<br>Many Japanese people practice both Shinto 
            and Buddhism; they can either identify with both religions or describe 
            themselves as non-religious or spiritual. Christianity was first introduced 
            into Japan by Jesuit missions starting in 1549. Today, 1% to 1.5% of the 
            population are Christians.

            You could visit multiple shrines, for example the Meiji Shrine. 
            Meiji Shrine, is a Shinto shrine in Shibuya, Tokyo, that is 
            dedicated to the deified spirits of Emperor Meiji and his wife, 
            Empress Shōken. The shrine does not contain the emperor's grave, 
            which is located at Fushimi-momoyama, south of Kyoto. This shrine 
            is surrounded by forest and located in the middle of Tokyo.

            Japan has nine forest ecoregions which reflect the climate and geography 
            of the islands. They range from subtropical moist broadleaf forests in the 
            Ryūkyū and Bonin Islands, to temperate broadleaf and mixed forests in the 
            mild climate regions of the main islands, to temperate coniferous forests 
            in the cold, winter portions of the northern islands.<br>Japan has over 90,000 
            species of wildlife as of 2019, including the brown bear, the Japanese macaque, 
            the Japanese raccoon dog, the small Japanese field mouse, and the Japanese 
            giant salamander.<br>A large network of national parks has been established to 
            protect important areas of flora and fauna as well as 52 Ramsar wetland sites. 
            Four sites have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List for their 
            outstanding natural value.
